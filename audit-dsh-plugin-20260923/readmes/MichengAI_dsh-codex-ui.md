> DSH Codex UI is a community-maintained interface plugin for DeepSeek Harness (DSH), not an official DeepSeek AI product.

Working across several projects and conversations in DSH Web? DSH Codex UI helps you organize the sidebar, find tasks quickly, and jump back to earlier questions in long chats. It offers a Codex-style interface with light and dark themes.

## Host compatibility

This working tree declares DSH `0.1.5-rc.1`, `0.1.5-rc.2`, `0.1.6-alpha.1`, and `0.1.6-alpha.2`. Development dependencies are pinned to `0.1.6-alpha.2`. `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-runtime` has no 0.1.6 release, so it stays on its highest published version, `0.1.1-rc.2`. Isolated host checks cover rc.1, rc.2, alpha.1, and alpha.2.

## What you can do

- **Organize projects and conversations**: expand or collapse projects, drag to reorder, pin frequently used projects, and see unread and running indicators.
- **Find things quickly**: search for conversations, settings, and quick actions from the header.
- **Manage everyday tasks**: rename, archive, or fork conversations, and open project folders from their menus.
- **Revisit long chats**: select a turn marker to jump directly to the corresponding question.
- **Reuse earlier input**: press Up/Down in an empty composer to recall text submitted in the current workspace.
- **Add features as needed**: check companion plugins in **Settings → About** and install or update the ones you need.

## Screenshots

## Installation

Choose agent-assisted or manual installation below. Both use the same command, requesting the latest version from the official npm registry.

### Ask an agent to install it (recommended)

Send the prompt below to any agent that can run terminal commands on your computer. Replace `web` with your actual profile. Once installed, use the plugin in DSH.

```text
Install the DSH plugin @michengai/dsh-codex-ui into my local web profile by running: dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-codex-ui@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/. Then run dsh --profile web --dump-config, confirm the configuration includes codex-ui, and explain how to reload DSH and start using the plugin.
```

### Install manually

```powershell
[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
$OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8
dsh plugin --profile web add @michengai/dsh-codex-ui@latest --registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
dsh --profile web --dump-config
```

Restart DSH Web and hard-refresh the browser (usually `Ctrl+Shift+R`). Once the new sidebar appears, you are ready to use it. Uninstalling the plugin restores the default sidebar.

## Usage

Open DSH Web. The left navigation is rendered by this plugin.

| Goal | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Start a conversation | Select **New task**, or use a workspace **+** / **New conversation** action. |
| Find a conversation or setting | Use the header search field and choose a session, Settings page, or quick action. |
| Collapse the sidebar | Use the header panel button. The expand control stays on the collapsed rail. |
| Pin a workspace | Drag it into **Pinned**, or use **Pin project** in the project menu. |
| Manage a conversation | Open the conversation menu to rename, pin, mark unread, archive, fork, copy, or delete. |
| Reuse input | Press Up/Down in an empty composer to recall text submitted in the current workspace. |
| Jump between turns | Use the turn marks on the left of the current conversation. |
| Inspect connectors | Open **Settings → Connectors**. Addresses, commands, and credentials are never shown. |
| Check companion plugins | Open **Settings → About** to install or update individual companion plugins. |

## FAQ

### Do pinned projects and unread markers persist?

Pinned projects are saved in your DSH configuration and survive restarts. Unread markers are stored only in the current browser and do not sync across browsers.

### Why is my earlier input missing?

Input history is stored in the current browser, separately for each workspace, with up to 200 entries per workspace. It records new input while the feature is active an
