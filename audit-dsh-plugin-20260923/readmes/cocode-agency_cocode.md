# Cocode

**A ready-to-run DeepSeek Harness distribution.**

Most coding agents make the choices for you and take the choice away with them:
which tools are available, how work gets scheduled, what the interface looks
like — all settled upstream. Cocode wants the other half of that bargain. It
makes the choices for you and leaves the screwdriver within reach: the default
setup works the moment you install it, with nothing to study first, and when it
doesn't fit you can open it up, see exactly how it was put together, and change
it to your liking. Everything else in Cocode follows from that.

The runtime underneath is DeepSeek Harness, which makes an argument of its own:
everything is a plugin. Models, tools, skills, sessions, sandboxes, and
scheduling all come together through configuration, and Harness takes no
position on what you should assemble. Cocode assembles one of those, and puts
the assembly out in the open in the product instead of burying it in a config
file.

> **Project status:** Developer preview. Cocode is built on the DeepSeek Harness
> developer preview. It is an independent distribution, not an official DeepSeek
> product, and upstream compatibility may change. The repository supports source
> builds on macOS, Windows, and Linux; the current release scripts target macOS
> and Windows artifacts, and this repository does not include a hosted backend or
> a vendored Harness checkout.

## Install and try it in five minutes

| Use case | Install | Start |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **GUI** | Download the installer for your platform from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/cocode-agency/cocode/releases) page. | Launch Cocode, then choose Cocode Pro with hosted Nut credits or your own DeepSeek-compatible key. |
| **TUI** | Node.js `22.19.x` or later (`24+` is also supported), then `npm install --global @cocode-agency/tui`. | Run `cocode doctor`, then `cocode`. A real terminal is required. |
| **From source** | Follow the component-specific pnpm instructions below. | Use `make dev gui` or `make dev tui`. |

The published TUI package installs the matching `@cocode-agency/host-supervisor`
automatically. For every release, keep `@cocode-agency/tui` and
`@cocode-agency/host-supervisor` on the same version line; do not mix versions from
different releases. GUI installers are downloaded separately from the matching
GitHub Release and are not installed through npm. The current repository is a
developer preview, so release availability and upstream Harness compatibility
can change.

### Five-minute first run

1. Install the GUI from GitHub Releases, or run `npm install --global @cocode-agency/tui`.
2. Start the GUI, or run `cocode doctor` followed by `cocode` in a real TTY.
3. Choose Cocode Pro / Cocode Nut, or enter your own DeepSeek-compatible API key.
4. Open a workspace and ask the agent to inspect a file or explain the project.
5. If startup fails, save the output of `cocode doctor` and
   `cocode host status --json` for troubleshooting. Remove credentials and
   private session data before sharing diagnostics.

## Why Cocode

**The agent itself comes apart.** Which tools a session runs, what prompts it
carries, which capabilities are on — that is a plugin assembly called a preset,
and you can read its `agent.cordis.yml` right in the interface. Four presets
ship built in — Standard, PTC, Minimal, and Creator — and you copy one to make
it yours. Elsewhere you get to swap the model. Here you get to swap the agent.

**A workspace, not a chat box.** Files, Git, a terminal, a built-in browser, and
diff previews sit alongside the session. What the agent changed and what it ran
is right there next to you, and you can take over by hand at any point instead
of carrying context between windows.

**The desktop and the terminal pick up the same session.** GUI and TUI connect
to the same Host and read and write the same session record. Push a task forward
at your desk, then SSH in and continue from the terminal — presentation state
never enters the session log, so any client can rebuild the full conversation
from it.

**The model is your call too.** An official DeepSeek key, any OpenAI-compatible
self-hosted or gateway endpoint, or Cocode Pro's hosted Cocode Nut service — all
three are available, and you can switch between them.

Cocode is not trying to be another chat window. It won't parade a full chain of
thought at you as a feature, and it won't hand the model every tool by default.
What it wants to be is a workspace you trust with real work — and one you can
reshape to your own liking.

## Two entry points, one session

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Cocode GUI** | A desktop workspace built on Electron. Sessions, files, terminals, and runtime state live on one surface. Diffs and attachments open in a preview panel, so you see exactly what changed before you confirm. |
| **Cocode TUI** | A terminal client for keyboard-first and remote work. SSH into a machine and keep pushing tasks with no graphical environment required. |

Both attach to the same Host through `@cocode-agency/host-supervisor`, so they can share
sessions and task state when they use the same `DSH_HOME`, profile, and Host
configuration scope. Switching between the desktop app and the terminal does
not reset your work within that scope.

## Repository layout

This repository is not a single workspace. Each component is an independent
pnpm workspace with its own lockfile and toolchain, tied together by a root
`Makefile`.

```text
cocode/
├── cocode-gui/               # Electron desktop / web GUI  (@cocode/gui-root)
├── cocode-tui/               # Terminal client             (@cocode-agency/tui)
├── cocode-host-supervisor/   # Shared DSH Host lifecycle   (@cocode-agency/host-supervisor)
├── Makefile                  # Root dev shortcuts
└── AGENTS.md                 # Engineering contract for contributors and agents
```

The runtime itself is not vendored here. `@cocode-agency/host-supervisor` pins
`@deepseek-ai/dsh` from npm and owns the Supervisor service, the local IPC and
lease protocol, runtime-slot materialization, and the Cocode JSON-RPC Host
plugin. GUI and TUI never launch a Harness process themselves — they acquire a
lease for a canonical `DSH_HOME + profile + Host configuration` scope and connect
to the endpoint the Host advertises.

```text

            ├─→ @cocode-agency/host-supervisor ─→ @deepseek-ai/dsh (npm) ─→ models · tools · sessions

### Upgrading DSH

DSH is released as one exact release train in Cocode. The canonical target is
`cocode-host-supervisor/package.json`'s `@deepseek-ai/dsh` dependency; the GUI
client packages and every `packages/cocode/*` plugin peer dependency must use
that same version.

After changing the DSH package versions and refreshing both lockfiles, run the
fast contract check first:

```sh
cd cocode-gui
corepack pnpm@10.34.5 install --frozen-lockfile --ignore-scripts
corepack pnpm@10.34.5 run check:dsh-contract
```

It checks all DSH declarations, installed package manifests, Cocode plugin
manifests, browser plugin entrypoints, and every `dsh.client.inject` target.
The complete gate rebuilds the plugins and Electron app, runs GUI/Host tests,
stages a clean npm DSH runtime, and verifies its closure and hashes:

```sh
corepack pnpm@10.34.5 run check:dsh-compatibility
```

Do not treat a successful TypeScript build alone as compatibility proof. A DSH
upgrade can change slot names, plugin injection, exported client entrypoints,
or runtime dependency closure; the clean staging and
