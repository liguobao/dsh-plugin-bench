# DeepSeek Harness for VS Code 🐋

> [!NOTE]
> ⭐ Like DSH Sidebar? [Give it a Star on GitHub](https://github.com/Lixxx1/dsh-vscode)! It helps more people find the project.

Bring DeepSeek Harness into the same place you write code. dsh-vscode gives DSH a Claude Code/Codex-style right sidebar that already understands your project, active file, and selected code.

Ask DeepSeek to inspect, change, and verify code without switching between your editor, terminal, and a separate chat window.

👋 I built this because I wanted DSH right beside my editor. If that sounds useful to you too, give it a try! I'd love to hear how it fits into your workflow.

## ✨ Features

- **Autonomous VS Code debugging.** Let DeepSeek launch the current project from `.vscode/launch.json`, manage breakpoints, step through execution, and inspect stack frames and local variables using VS Code's native debugger.
- **Official DSH inside VS Code.** Sessions, streaming responses, tool calls, approvals, and follow-up questions run through the official DSH runtime.
- **Project-aware editor context.** The active file, selected code, and `@file` or `@folder` references travel with your prompt.
- **Session controls where you need them.** Switch Permission and Plan modes, choose Model and Reasoning Effort, or steer an active task.
- **Native review and safe revert.** Review changes in VS Code's Diff Editor, Keep or Revert edits, and stop DSH before it overwrites a file with unsaved changes.
- **Extend DSH from the sidebar.** Discover and manage Tools, Skills, MCP integrations, Memory, and Agent Hooks loaded by DSH.

## 📦 Install

Install the official DeepSeek Harness CLI:

```sh
npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh
```

Then choose the extension channel that fits you:

### Published release

Open **Extensions** in VS Code, search for **DSH Sidebar**, and select **Install**. You can also install it from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=lixxx1.dsh-sidebar).

### Latest development build

To try features already available on `main` but not yet published to the Marketplace, build and install the latest VSIX:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Lixxx1/dsh-vscode.git
cd dsh-vscode
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run package
```

In VS Code, run **Extensions: Install from VSIX...** from the Command Palette and select `dsh-vscode.vsix`. Development builds move faster and may be less stable; pull the latest changes and rebuild the VSIX to update.

Requires VS Code 1.100 or newer and Node.js `^22.19` or `>=24`.

Installing community runtime plugins also requires `pnpm` on your PATH.

## 🚀 Use

1. Open a trusted project folder in VS Code.
2. Select **DeepSeek** in the right sidebar. If it is hidden, find it under **Other Views**.
3. Use the key button to configure `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
4. Choose the Permission mode, Model, and Reasoning Effort, then start working. Use the Shield menu for Permission and Plan modes, `/` for official DSH commands, and `@` to add files or folders.
5. Use the plugins button in the sidebar title to search, install, inspect, or remove community runtime plugins.

### Autonomous debugging

Enable **DeepSeek Harness: Autonomous Debugging** in VS Code Settings and add a debug configuration to `.vscode/launch.json`.

DeepSeek can then start the debugger, set breakpoints, step through execution, inspect runtime values, fix the code, and verify the result directly from the sidebar.

Requires DeepSeek Harness `0.1.2-rc.1` or a compatible newer release. Tested with `0.1.5-rc.1`.
