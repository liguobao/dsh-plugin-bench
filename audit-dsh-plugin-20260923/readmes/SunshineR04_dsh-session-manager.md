# dsh-session-manager

A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) plugin that
**permanently deletes sessions**, with a cross-workspace archived-session list
to do it from and a red **Delete permanently** item in the session context menu.

[中文文档](README.zh.md)

## What dsh already does, and what this plugin is for

**DeepSeek Harness never deletes a session's files.** Its own *Delete workspace*
action says so outright: *"This removes "{name}" from the workspace list. The
folder and session logs will be kept. Its sessions will appear under
Ungrouped."* A long-lived install therefore accumulates one session directory
per conversation forever, with no way to reclaim the disk.

**Archive/restore is no longer a gap.** Since dsh 0.1.7 the official product
ships archive and unarchive in the session ⋯ menu, a sidebar
**Show archived** / **Archived only** view filter, an undo toast, and an
admission gate that stops an archived session (and its subagent descendants)
from running model steps. Use those — this plugin does not try to replace them.

| Capability | Official (dsh 0.1.7) | This plugin |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Archive / unarchive | ✅ ⋯ menu, stop-work confirm, undo toast | ✅ |
| Find archived sessions | ✅ sidebar **Show archived** filter | ✅ one list across **all** workspaces |
| **Delete session files** | ❌ never | ✅ red **Delete permanently** |
| Bulk operations | ❌ | ✅ select all + delete in one confirmed run |

Every delete is a **direct physical deletion** — there is no backup layer.

## Features

### 1. Settings page: Settings → Session Manager

- Lists every **archived session**: title, owning workspace, project directory,
  update time, running state
- **Restore** (returns to its pre-archive position) and red
  **Delete permanently** per session
- **Select all + bulk delete**: tick rows (or the header checkbox) and delete
  every selected session in one confirmed action. The run is serial and
  tolerant: a failing session is reported in full while the rest still go
  through, sessions with a running task are skipped (the dialog says how many
  before you commit), and the per-run result is one summary — clean, partially
  failed, or all-running refused
- Destructive confirm dialog — every delete is a direct physical delete,
  there is no backup layer
- Backed by the official session / workspace client stores — fully reactive

### 2. Session context menu: red "Delete permanently"

Hover a session row in the left sidebar → ⋯ menu: below the built-in
Rename / Fork session / Archive session items, a red **Delete permanently**
item appears (native danger styling, same confirm dialog).

> The official workspace browser exposes no slot for session menus, so the
> plugin augments the rendered popup via DOM observation + React-fiber
> resolution. The augmentation is passive: if the host UI structure changes
> and resolution fails, the button simply does not appear — nothing else is
> affected.

### 3. Agent tools

| Tool | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `session_list_archived` | List archived sessions as JSON |
| `session_restore_archived` | Restore by id (reversible, no confirmation) |
| `session_delete_permanently` | Delete by id; **requires `confirm: true`**; refuses running sessions |

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SunshineR04/dsh-session-manager.git
dsh plugin --profile <name> add "file:/path/to/dsh-session-manager"
```

`dsh plugin add` installs through pnpm and appends the package to
`dsh.profile.bundles`; this package's `cordis.patch.yml` bundle layer mounts
the plugin row automatically. **Restart the dsh desktop app afterwards**
(new bundles are not hot-loaded).

Alternatively mount it manually in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (the
bundle channel above is easier):

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: session-manager
      name: dsh-session-manager
```

## Delete semantics

Deleting runs in this order:

1. **Open sessions only**: a persistent pending-deletion marker is written
   **before any mutation** (crash safety — a crash mid-delete always leaves
   the next boot a marker to sweep), right after the read-only existence
   check; malformed ids read back from that queue file are pattern-validated
   before any filesystem use.
2. **Registry bookkeeping (durable + broadcast)**: detaches the id from
   its workspace's `sessionIds` and removes it from the global archive set.
   The detach does not trust the workspace's filtered `sessionIds` view alone —
   a stale registry header index can hide the id from that getter (which used
   to let deleted sessions survive, resurfacing as *ungrouped* entries), so
   the raw workspace record is checked as a fallback.
3. Removes the session artifact directory
   `~/.dsh/sessions/<encoded-project>/<session-id>/` (`session.jsonl.zstd`).
   The directory is resolved through three seams in turn — registry header +
   persistence `locate`, the persistence header listing, then a raw scan of
   the sessions root for a directory named exactly the session id — so a
   degenerated header seam can no longer silently skip the deletion.
4. Removes the metadata checkpoint
   `~/.dsh/storages/session_projcache/sessions/<id>.json` (and `.bak-*`).
5. **Broadcasts the official `api-session/removed` event**, so every connected
   client drops the session from its list store immediately. (The host itself
   only emits this event when a live session is disposed, which a cold delete
   never is.)

The SQLite search index reconciles itself once the source files are gone;
attachments are content-addressed and intentionally kept.

- Every delete is a **direct physical deletion** — there is no backup
  layer, so double-check the confirm dialog.
- **Deleting an open session works immediately**: its registry accounting,
  files and metadata are removed at once (post-delete flushes cannot recreate
  anything — appends open the log by path and never recreate a deleted
  directory). Because dsh has no public "close session" API, the in-memory
  copy lingers (and still shows in that open view) until the owning UI scope
  dies; the id is kept in the archive set as a **tombstone**, so it is hidden
  from the workspace browser and every listing meanwhile, and the next dsh
  restart finishes the cleanup. Running sessions are still refused.
- **Pending banner**: the settings page lists only the sessions you can
  still act on. Entries with files on disk (e.g. a mid-delete crash leftover)
  get a row with **Cancel deletion**, which clears the tombstone as well
  (registry first, marker second, so a failure leaves the entry fully
  retryable). Entries whose files are already gone (the normal open-session
  delete) have nothing left to act on, so they collapse into a single
  "already deleted · clears after restart" summary line with an optional
  expander for their ids instead of occupying the banner — and canceling one
  is refused by the host too (`session/data-gone`), not just hidden by the UI.
- Restore only removes the id from the archive set — archiving keeps the
  workspace `sessionIds` slot, so the session returns to its previous position.
  A queued-for-deletion id is refused with `session/pending` (cancel it first
  when its files are still on disk); restoring one would expose an
  artifact-less husk.

## Config

| Field | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sessionListLimit` | `500` | Max entries per list call |
| `allowDeleteRunning` | `false` | Force-delete sessions with a **running** task (skips the refusal and the tombstone — dangerous; open-**idle** sessions delete immediately either way) |
| `toolDeleteRequiresConfirm` | `true` | Agent delete tool requires `confirm: true` |
| `menuDeleteAvailable` | `true` | Mount the red menu item |

## Develop

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test   # syntax check + host unit tests + client render smoke tests
```

The render tests mount the real client settings section with React inside
jsdom (`test/client.render.test.mjs`) — they catch UI crashes the host
