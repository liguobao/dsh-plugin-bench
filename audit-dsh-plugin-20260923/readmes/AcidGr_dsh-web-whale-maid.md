## ✨ Features

- **8 Mood Frame Animations**:
  - `idle`, `hungry`, `happy`, `angry`, `eating`, `scared`, `sad`, and `thinking`.
  - Built from a 1024x2048 HD sprite sheet processed with chroma keying and custom despill algorithms for clean, crisp edges on Retina screens.
- **Strict Mood & LLM Linkage**:
  - The pet's mood and animation only change when an LLM invocation occurs; otherwise, it remains in its current state.
  - **Thinking Animation**: Whenever an LLM call starts (upon feeding or work session completion), the pet immediately transitions into the `thinking` animation. When the LLM outputs its response, the pet switches to the result mood and renders its speech bubble.
- **Dual-Zone Touch & Persistent Speech Bubble**:
  - **Permanent Bubble**: Speech bubbles and moods remain permanently on screen until the next LLM response arrives.
  - **Clicking Pet Body**: Opens the antique wooden maid cupboard modal.
  - **Clicking Speech Bubble**: Immediately dismisses the speech bubble and resets the pet back to standard standby (`idle`) mode.
- **Sidebar Footer Toggle & Instant Dormant Sleep Mode**:
  - Dedicated one-click toggle button rendered at the bottom of the DSH sidebar (`sidebar.footer.action` beside Settings), fully responsive across expanded and rail modes;
  - Features an instant "Put to Sleep" button inside the cupboard header;
  - Dormant mode completely unmounts the overlay DOM (zero screen occlusion) and cuts off all LLM session event watchers and Token consumption, with instant millisecond wake-up without page reloads.
- **Satiety Reserve Pool (Tokens as Food)**:
  - 30,000 Token maximum capacity.
  - Four tiers of rice food items on the shelf:
    - `Grain of Rice` (+1 Token)
    - `Spoon of Rice` (+1,000 Tokens)
    - `Bowl of Rice` (+3,000 Tokens)
    - `Pot of Rice` (+10,000 Tokens)
  - 5 perception tiers: `Starving!` (<2,000), `Very Hungry!` (2,000-5,000), `Not hungry, but wouldn't mind a snack!` (5,000-10,000), `Satiated & Content` (10,000-20,000), and `Stuffed!` (>20,000).
- **Body & Bubble Size Scaling Slider**:
  - Continuous size scale slider located inside the cupboard drawer (50% to 180% range, 5% step).
  - Scales both the whale maid pet and its speech bubble simultaneously in perfect proportion.
  - Features real-time percentage display and a quick "Reset" button to 100%, with preferences persisted to disk and localStorage.
- **Universal DSH Model Auto-Discovery**:
  - Automatically parses and synchronizes all providers and models configured in `~/.dsh/settings.yaml` (including custom OpenAI-compatible proxies, Ollama, Claude, etc.) alongside DeepSeek official models.
  - Automatically identifies the active `agent-default-model` as the initial preference, and refreshes models dynamically whenever the cupboard modal opens. Zero machine-specific hardcoding.
- **Mobile-Responsive Antique Cupboard Modal**:
  - Automatically scales down proportionally based on viewport size (`min(92vw/640, 88vh/580)`) and centers smoothly on narrow mobile screens, eliminating clipping.
  - **Instant Close on Feed**: Tapping any rice item automatically closes the cupboard modal, allowing the user to watch the pet's thinking animation and response on the main screen right away.
  - Smooth mobile momentum scrolling on the speech ledger.
- **Speech Ledger & Dual-Layer Persistence**:
  - Records up to 20 past LLM dialogue entries including moods, timestamps, food/session titles, and tokens used.
  - Stored concurrently to disk (`pet_durable_memory.json`) and browser `localStorage`.
- **Context Awareness & Strict Prompt Constraints**:
  - Aggregates tasks completed in DSH within the past 5 hours to generate tailored commentary and avoid repetitive responses.
  - **Zero Emojis**: Strictly forbids all emojis across all prompts, UI elements, and dialogues. Single-line JSON format bounded within 25 Chinese characters.
