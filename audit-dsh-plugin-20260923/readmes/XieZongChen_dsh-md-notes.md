## Overview

A note-taking plugin for [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH). It provides a full **MD notes manager** and **MD notes editor**, letting you quickly capture conversation content into notes. Notes can be maintained by syncing to a Git repository.

**Who it's for**: DSH web users who want local, file-based notes (no database, no cloud) — capture a conversation into a note with one click, keep editing the `.md` anywhere, and back up / sync with a Git repository.

**Current features**:

- **Sidebar notes entry** → full-screen notes manager: per-workspace note list (grouped, collapsible), markdown edit/preview, save, delete (in-page confirm), create with one click.
- **Note search**: a search box in the manager's top bar scans every workspace — titles and bodies (space-separated keywords, AND, case-insensitive); results are grouped by workspace with highlighted matched lines, and clicking a hit opens the note in the editor on that line with the keyword selected; each note row also has a "view in sidebar" action (dsh ≥ 0.1.5-rc).
- **Right-sidebar note viewer** (dsh ≥ 0.1.5-rc): conversation file links, the file tree, search, and `@` chip clicks all open notes rendered as markdown in dsh's right dockable sidebar; interlinks jump to new tabs; local images in the body render inline (editing stays in the manager).
- **Assistant-message action** (next to copy) → pick or create a note and append that conversation (user question + answer) to it **instantly** — the text is captured from the conversation itself, so there's no waiting; section labels are localized (reasoning is not captured — only the final answer).
- **Reference notes in chat (`@`)**: type `@` to pick notes (cross-workspace included, plugin-logo-led candidate rows); clicking an inserted chip previews the note in the right sidebar; on send the plugin's backend injects each note's content into the model context, so the model can cite it without being asked to read files. Reference lines carry relative paths only, never local absolute paths.
- **Git sync** (optional, URL-driven): **shared repo** mode (one repo for all workspaces, per-workspace folders) or **own repos** mode (per workspace: URL + branch + subpath). Push = mirror-sync (deletions included), Update = pull with three-way conflict confirmation, auto-pull on open, merge-remote-and-retry. Each workspace shows a **Git sync card** in the manager: "Synced" / "N unpushed" status, plus a hint when the remote has new commits.
- **Note write mutex**: writes to the same note are locked across sessions — the sidebar entry, picker and manager stay in sync until the write finishes.
- **Settings panel** (dsh Settings → MD Notes): mode, repo URL/branch/subpath, auto-pull, commit author — with dsh-styled form controls.
- **Theme & i18n**: token-based colors (light/dark), UI copy follows dsh's language (Chinese / English), error messages localized.
- **Update notifications**: a yellow "Update available" tag appears when a newer npm version exists.

**On the roadmap** (see [docs/TODO.md](docs/TODO.md)): visual Git conflict rendering & resolution, note capability enhancements (TOC / wiki links & backlinks), and interaction UX polish (dirty-editor reminders, save shortcut, etc.).

## Compatibility

dsh iterates fast and provides **no backward compatibility**, so a fixed dsh version only
matches fixed plugin versions. Verified combinations are listed below (full adaptation
history in [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md)):

**Version alignment rule**: the plugin aligns only with dsh **stable versions** — `rc`
and (future) `final` releases. dsh's npm `latest` dist-tag points at an rc, which is what
users actually install; alphas ship every day or two and are superseded by the line's rc
within about a week, so they are **not adapted per-version** — one rc check covers the
whole line's alpha range, and a specific alpha is checked only when the plugin wants to use
a capability it introduced or to confirm a breaking change. The table below therefore only
lists rc/final versions (early alpha rows are kept as history).

| Plugin version | dsh version | Verified on |
|---|---|---|
| 0.13.0 | `0.1.5-rc.2` | 2026-09-11 |
| 0.12.0 | `0.1.3-alpha.2` | 2026-09-07 |
| 0.11.0 | `0.1.3-alpha.2` | 2026-09-07 |

The plugin is not pinned to a specific mainline commit; pin the plugin version at install
time if you need a fixed combination (e.g. `dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-md-notes@0.13.0`).
Runtime dependencies (`@deepseek-ai/*`, `react`) are declared as optional peer dependencies
and resolve from the dsh installation.

**Unreleased (`NEXT_VERSION`)**: it adapts to dsh `0.1.7-rc.1` (Session V4 producer-owned
message sources; the `*16` icon family renamed `*Medium`) **and requires dsh ≥ `0.1.7-rc.1`** —
0.1.7 replaced `ctx.settings.register()` with `SettingsForms` + `volatile` Config fields, and a
plugin built for it does not load on older dsh. Until it is released, **use 0.13.0 on dsh
`0.1.5-rc.2`**.

## Install / Uninstall

Prerequisites: `dsh` CLI installed, target profile is `web`.

Install from npm (recommended):

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-md-notes
```

Then **restart dsh web** (bundle layer and client package metadata are cached in the process; a restart is required for changes to take effect).

Upgrade:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web update dsh-md-notes
```

A restart of dsh web is required for it to take effect.

Uninstall:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web remove dsh-md-notes
```

> For development/debugging from source: run `dsh plugin --profile web add ./dsh-md-notes`
> from the parent directory of the plugin project.

## Quick start

1. Install the plugin (above), restart dsh web.
2. **Create a note**: click the notes entry at the bottom of the sidebar (above Settings) → click **+** on a workspace row → in the dialog enter a title (default "Untitled note <date>") and an optional **file name** → type in the editor → **Save**.
3. **Capture a conversation**: below any assistant answer, click the notes icon (next to copy) → pick a target note (or create one on the spot) → **Write to note**. The user question + answer are appended to the note as a "<session title> -- <timestamp>" section.
4. **Reference a note**: type `@` in the chat input to pick a note (cross-workspace included); on send the note's content enters the model context automatically.

Note files live in each workspace's `.dsh-notes/` directory (`<workspace>/.dsh-notes`); you can open and edit them directly with any editor. Git sync is optional — point the plugin at a repo URL and it keeps notes in sync (shared repo or per-workspace repo).

> For everything the plugin can do — the notes manager, capturing conversations, Git sync (shared / per-workspace repos), pushing/updating, conflict handling, and the settings panel — see the [User Guide](docs/usage.md).

## Configuration

All options are plugin Config keys, overridable in the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` (a patch replaces the whole `config` of the row):

```yaml
- id: md-notes
  config:
    gitMode: 'off'               # 'off' | 'shared' | 'own'
    gitAutoPull: true            # pull remote before opening a note
```

The HTTP API prefix is fixed at `/plugins/md-notes` (the browser frontend hardcodes the same constant, so it is intentionally not configurable).

|---|---|---|
