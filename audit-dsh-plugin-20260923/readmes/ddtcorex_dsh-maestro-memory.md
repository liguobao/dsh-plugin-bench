# dsh-maestro-memory

Durable memory and todos for DeepSeek Harness (DSH) — preserves `~/.dsh/memories` in place.

> Give the AI cross-session durable memory and todos — the more you use it, the more it understands you.

- **Package:** `@ddtcorex/dsh-maestro-memory` (`cordis.patch.yml` id `maestro-memory`)
- **Version:** `2.0.0` · **Changelog:** `CHANGELOG.md`

## Requirements

- Node.js 22+, pnpm 11+
- DSH `deepseek-harness` master

## Install

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run build   # -> lib/
pnpm test        # vitest run
```

**DSH profile (operator):**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:<workspace-root>/packages/dsh-maestro-memory
# production: dsh plugin --profile web add github:ddtcorex/dsh-maestro-memory#<tag-or-sha>
```

`cordis.patch.yml` is shipped with the package — do not duplicate it in the profile.

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: maestro-memory
      name: '@ddtcorex/dsh-maestro-memory'
      config:
        memoryDir: null      # -> ~/.dsh/memories
        snapshotOrder: 500
        autoMemory: { enabled: false, userMessage: true, desensitize: true } # opt-in
        writeGuard: { enabled: false, threshold: 2 }  # per-turn write watchdog, opt-in
```

`writeGuard` is read once at `apply()` time — changing it needs a profile edit and a
host restart. `threshold` counts consecutive *working* human turns with no
`daily`/`project` write; any value below 1 is read as 1.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `memory` | Five tracks `memory`/`user`/`project`/`key`/`daily` + archive/expand. `key` is gated via `memory_suggest`. |
| `maestro_todo` | Durable cross-session todo store (four tracks `life`/`work`/`project`/`daily` with ids, smart view max 8). Named apart from the harness's own in-session task list `todo_write`. |
| `memory_suggest` | Gated proposals to `SUGGESTIONS.jsonl` — requires human approve. |

`memory` sanitizes sensitive fragments (`[Filtered:API key/password/token/ID/phone]`, pure credential → `content filtered`).

## System Prompt Snapshot

`memory:snapshot` (order 500) injects bounded deterministic context:

`USER + MEMORY + KEY (branch-filtered) + Project Context (auto-recall top-4, 600 chars each, cap 1024) + Recent Daily (last 2 days, 512) + header + discipline note`

Caps: `memory 2048 / user 4096 / key 6144 / recentDaily 512 / autoRecall 1024`, plus
per-section entry budgets `memory 8 / user 8 / key 12 / recentDaily 2 / autoRecall 4`.

A cap is hard in **both** dimensions. The newest entry is always kept — compacted
to `head + [summary:…]` when it carries a summary tag. An untagged entry larger
than twice its byte cap is truncated with an explicit `…[truncated]` marker
instead of being kept whole: before that rule, a single 2,293-byte global entry
owned the 2,048-byte section and pushed every other entry out of the prompt.

**Cost reporting.** `renderSnapshotWithStats` (the renderer behind
`memory:snapshot`) reports the bytes, entry count and excluded-entry count of
every section. The host keeps the last 50 renders in memory and returns them as
`cost` on `/dsh-maestro-memory-health`: `samples`, `last`, `medianTotalBytes`,
`maxTotalBytes`, `medianBySection`. Entry text is never retained — byte counts
only.

**Write watchdog.** With `writeGuard.enabled`, the host counts consecutive human
turns in which work happened but no `daily`/`project` entry was written
(`agent/turn-stopping`). Three things must hold for a turn to count:

1. it was opened by a direct human prompt — goal-continuation rounds
   (`source.kind === 'goal'`) and injected context (`'plugin'`, e.g. wake
   notices) carry no per-turn duty;
2. it is not a subagent session;
3. it **dispatched at least one tool call**. A turn that only answered a
   question is conversation, not work, so no debt accrues — otherwise the
   watchdog would push the model to write filler entries, exactly what the
   discipline note forbids.

Once the gap reaches `threshold`, the snapshot gains a
`# ⚠️ Memory Write Backlog` section immediately before the discipline note, and
it stays until a write succeeds.
Only a write that actually recorded something counts — a deduplicated add does
not. The alert text is static (threshold only, never the live count), so one
open gap costs at most two tail snapshots: appear, then disappear.

**Subagent sessions** (`session.header.origin === 'subagent'`) get a restrained
per-achievement cadence instead of the per-turn duty, and never see the backlog
alert. The shared memory context (MEMORY / USER / KEY / Project Context) is
still injected for them.

The rendered snapshot collapses brace runs of two or more to a single brace: DSH interpolates each prompt context and fails the whole turn on a `{{name}}` group with a malformed or unregistered name, so free-form memory prose never reaches it as template syntax.

## UI & RPC

One `conversation.view` slot (`maestro-memory`, order 40) with tabs **Memory / Review / Todos / Skills / Health**. Health shows `coverage`, `daily last 7d`, `longest` + 5-dim score `S/R/J/C/Safety` (composite `min*0.4+mean*0.6`).

The **Memory** tab lists each track read-only and carries a manual add composer:
pick a track, type an entry, press Add. It posts `memory.mutate` with
`action: 'add'`, so it needs no model round-trip; drafts are kept per track and
the button stays disabled while the entry is empty or while `key`/`project` has
no cwd. The model's `key` gate is `exec.agent`-scoped on the host, so it stays in
force — a human writing `key` here is equivalent to approving a queued
suggestion.

RPC: `/dsh-maestro-memory` + loopback `/dsh-maestro-memory-health` + `/dsh-maestro-memory-propose`.

Maintenance endpoints on `/dsh-maestro-memory` (both **preview-first**: `dryRun`
defaults to `true` and an actual write needs `confirm: true`):

| Endpoint | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `memory.repair` | Splits entries glued without the `§` delimiter, drops exact duplicates and moves a trailing `[summary:…]` to its canonical header position, across every store file. Reports `files / changed / split / deduped / relocated`. |
| `memory.maintenance` | Plans (and optionally applies) the archive of the oldest entries of `memory`/`user`/`key`/`project` beyond `DEFAULT_ARCHIVE_POLICY` (keep-bytes + max-age). Overgrown entries move to the track's `*-archive.md`; they are never dropped. |

**Archive vs. the two-machine sync.** `sync/` merges `MEMORY.md`, `KEY.md` and `KEY-archive.md`
as a **union** — it never drops a version, and project/global entries carry no `[id:…]`, so a
*deletion* on one machine is indistinguishable from "the other machine has not seen it yet".
Consequences worth knowing before archiving:

- Archiving on ONE machine only is not stable: the next union merge pulls the archived entries
  back into the live file, because the peer still carries them there. Archive on every machine
  (same policy) so both sides agree and the union is a no-op, or archive with sync disabled.
- `MEMORY-archive.md` is **not** in the merge set (only `KEY-archive.md` is), so a project-track
  archive stays local. That is safe for the live file but means the two machines' archive files
  can legitimately differ.
- The archive does not change what the prompt shows: `# Project Key Memory` is capped at 6,144 B
  and `# Project Context` at the newest 4 entries, both far below the archive policy's keep
  budget. Verified on the live store: rendering was byte-identical before and after the run.

One repair pass runs once at boot, gated by a flag file under
`<root>/.maestro-memory/` (`maestroMetaDir`): `delimiter-repaired-v3` covers
every store file and writes its run report into the flag. (v1 was a KEY-only pass
that had been a silent no-op — it was called with a bogus cwd — and v2 covered
the store without the stray-delimiter split; the versioned flag is what lets an
existing machine pick up a new repair rule exactly once.)
