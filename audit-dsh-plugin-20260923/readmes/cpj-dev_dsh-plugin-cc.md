Claude Code plugin that runs **DeepSeek Harness** (`dsh`) from slash commands: review, critique, one-shot tasks, and resumable multi-turn sessions.

Pin: [`@deepseek-ai/dsh@0.1.1-rc.2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deepseek-ai/dsh). After upgrading the plugin, rerun `/dsh:setup`. Re-verify [docs/dsh-compat.md](docs/dsh-compat.md) on every dsh upgrade.

## Agent modes

Default is **`standard`**. `minimal` and `anchored-standard` are switches — they are not the default.

| Mode | Tools the model sees |
|---|---|
| **`standard`** (default) | Full dsh-base catalog from request #1 (search, skills, subagents, …). No overlay. |
| `minimal` | bash + `str_replace_editor` for the **whole** run. Extra tools cannot appear later. |
| `anchored-standard` | Those two tools first. After this session records a tool call **or** an assistant reply, the next assemble restores the full catalog. |

Switch:

- this run: `/dsh:run --mode minimal …` or `--mode anchored-standard`
- this shell: `DSH_CC_MODE=minimal`
- this machine: `/dsh:setup --mode minimal`

A broker (`--session` / `--resume` / `/dsh:import`) keeps the mode it started with. Mismatch → `/dsh:stop --broker`.

## Quick start

Needs Node >= 20 and a `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`. `/dsh:setup` also needs Node >= 22.19, `npm`, and `pnpm` (`corepack enable`).

```bash
/plugin marketplace add cpj-dev/dsh-plugin-cc
/plugin install dsh@deepseek-dsh
/dsh:setup
/dsh:review
```

Already have a built [deepseek-harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) checkout? `/dsh:setup --harness <path>`. Already have a `dsh` binary? set `DSH_BINARY`. Uninstall: remove the plugin, the plugin data dir, and `~/.dsh/profiles/cc`.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/dsh:check` | Readiness probe |
| `/dsh:setup` | Install pinned npm CLI (or `--harness`) and the multi-turn `cc` profile |
| `/dsh:review [focus]` | Read-only review of local changes |
| `/dsh:critique [focus]` | Structured adversarial critique |
| `/dsh:run <task>` | Task (`--write`, `--session`, `--resume`, `--mode`, `--background`) |
| `/dsh:delegate <task>` | Background handoff via the `dsh-delegate` subagent |
| `/dsh:import` | Weak-import this conversation into a resumable dsh session |
| `/dsh:runs` / `/dsh:show` | List runs / replay a stored result |
| `/dsh:stop` / `--broker` | Kill a run / the shared broker |

## Known limitations (v1)

- No mid-run approvals. Permissions are decided before launch (`--write` or not).
- Fresh one-shot runs are not resumable. Only `--session` / `--resume` / `/dsh:import` record session ids, and those live only as long as the broker process.
- Stop = kill. The SDK wire has no per-turn cancel; stopping a mid-turn broker run discards in-memory sessions.
- `/dsh:import` is a compressed text digest, not native history replay. Non-text Claude blocks (including images) are dropped.
- Visual understanding stays with Claude. Slash `$ARGUMENTS` is text; this plugin never forwards pasted images to DSH. `--model deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` only changes the model id. There is no `--image` flag. Native DSH vision belongs in `dsh web` / TUI. In `standard`, DSH may `read_image` a repo file — that is not a product path for Claude chat images.
- POSIX only. Windows is out of scope.
