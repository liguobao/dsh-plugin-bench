A [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) plugin that puts [graft](https://github.com/trailhq/Graft) — a prebuilt graph of every symbol, its `file:line` span, and who calls what — in front of both you and the model.

It does four things:

- **A chip in the composer** naming the graft index the current session is actually serving, whether it still matches the code, and how many tokens graft has saved in that repo.
- **Five tools for the model** — `graft_ask`, `graft_grep`, `graft_callers`, `graft_skeleton`, `graft_map` — resolved per session, so one dsh can serve several workspaces at once.
- **`/graft`** to build or rebuild the index, and **auto-rebuild** after the model edits files.
- **A `graft viz` button** that opens the graph in dsh's built-in right sidebar (0.1.5+), in [dsh-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar) if you still run it, and in a browser tab as the last resort.

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-graft-plugin
dsh --profile web
```

**pnpm 10 and later block `postinstall` scripts from unapproved packages**, and dsh skips writing the plugin's bundle row whenever the install exits non-zero — the dependency lands, the plugin stays invisible, and dsh starts up cleanly with no error to search for. If `add` ends with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`, approve and re-run it:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web && pnpm approve-builds      # tick dsh-graft-plugin
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-graft-plugin      # re-run so the bundle row gets written
```

Confirm it mounted — the plugin must appear in **both** `dependencies` and `dsh.profile.bundles` in the profile's `package.json`:

```sh
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web && node -e "const p=require('./package.json');
  console.log(p.dependencies['dsh-graft-plugin'],
              p.dsh.profile.bundles.includes('dsh-graft-plugin'))"
```

Every tool here shells out to the `graft` CLI, so it needs `@nanonets/graft` on PATH:

```sh
npm install -g @nanonets/graft
```

A `postinstall` does this for you **when your package manager runs lifecycle scripts** — under pnpm 10+ they are blocked by default, so treat the command above as the required step there, not a fallback. If your global npm prefix needs elevation, the postinstall says so and prints the one command to run by hand.

Then index a repo once:

```sh
cd <your repo>
graft build
```

### The sidebar tab

On dsh `0.1.5` and later the button opens the graph in **dsh's own right sidebar** — a tab titled Graft, also listed on the sidebar's guide page as "The graft graph for this workspace" — and a second click focuses the tab that is already open. No install needed for that path: the registration is soft, so an older dsh without the right sidebar falls through to `dsh-better-sidebar` when it is mounted, and to a browser tab when neither is there.

If your profile still runs `dsh-better-sidebar`, that path is tried **first** and behaves exactly as before. It ships as a dependency of this plugin (0.18.x), so it is already downloaded — but dsh only mounts what the profile lists:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-better-sidebar
```

> **Compatibility.** `dsh-better-sidebar` 0.18.x requires `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`, which dsh removed in `0.1.5-rc.2`. On that version or later it will not mount — which is exactly the profiles where the built-in right sidebar takes over instead. Everything else in this plugin — chip, tools, `/graft`, auto-rebuild — is unaffected.

The chip, the tools, `/graft` and the auto-rebuild all work without any sidebar; the button simply falls back to a browser tab when neither one is present.

> This plugin does **not** insert a `dsh-better-sidebar` row itself, on purpose. That package's own bundle row carries a guard that disables it when another enabled row already mounts the same package. A second row with a different id makes that guard circular, and the losing outcome is *your existing sidebar silently disabling itself*. One explicit command is worth more than that risk.

## What you get

### The chip

Sits in the composer next to the model name:

```
● graft · my-repo          in sync
◐ graft · my-repo          syncing
▲ graft · my-repo          stale
```

Hovering (or clicking) opens a card with the resolved root, node and edge counts, freshness, the running saved-token tally, and the `graft viz` button.

The root is resolved from **the session's own workspace**, not from wherever dsh was launched. That is the whole reason this exists rather than the `graft mcp` server: `graft mcp` resolves its repo once, from its own working directory at startup, and nothing can re-point it afterwards. Launched from a home directory it answers *"no graph found"* for every workspace you open.

### The visualiser

The `graft viz` button opens the graph as a tab — in dsh's built-in right sidebar on `0.1.5`+, in [dsh-better-sidebar](https://github.com/omdsh-dev/DSH-better-sidebar) if that is what you run. The context view lays out the whole graph:

The code view drills into a single file — what it contains, what it depends on, what depends on it:

### The tools

| tool | what it answers |
|---|---|
| `graft_ask` | "how does X work" / "where is Y" — ranked hits with code inlined at exact `file:line` |
| `graft_grep` | every occurrence, grouped by enclosing symbol (`graft_ask` is top-N and misses some) |
| `graft_callers` | who calls a symbol, what it calls, or the full blast radius before a rename |
| `graft_skeleton` | a file's whole API in ~200 tokens |
| `graft_map` | orientation in an unfamiliar tree |

None of them take a boolean parameter. They take string enums instead — `detail: "full"` rather than `full: true` — which reads better to a model and sidesteps a real failure mode on some OpenAI-compatible servers, where a tool call that *sets* a boolean is emitted as literal `<tool_call>` text and never runs.

### `/graft`

- `/graft` — build the index, or rebuild it if one exists
- `/graft status` — what the chip knows, as text
- `/graft deep` — a full rebuild

### Auto-rebuild

After the model writes or edits files, the index is rebuilt in the background, debounced so a long turn does not rebuild on every keystroke. This reuses graft's own sync runner rather than reimplementing it, so it cannot drift from what `graft build` does.

## Configuration

All optional, all on the plugin's row in your profile's `cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- id: graft-status
  name: 'dsh-graft-plugin'
  config:
    cwd: 'C:/path/to/repo'   # pin to one repo instead of resolving per session
    tools: false             # drop the graft_* tools, keep the chip
    command: false           # drop /graft
    promptSection: false     # stop telling the model to prefer graft
    autoBuild: false         # stop rebuilding after edits
```

## Requirements

| dsh | status |
|---|---|
| `0.1.2-rc.1` – `0.1.0-rc.7` | tested, full feature set — the `graft viz` tab via `dsh-better-sidebar` |
| `0.1.5-rc.2` / `0.1.5` | tested — chip, tools, `/graft` and auto-rebuild all work; on `0.1.5` the `graft viz` button opens the graph in the built-in right sidebar |

- Node 22+
- the `graft` CLI on PATH (`npm install -g @nanonets/graft`)

The client bundle requires only `react`, which is why it survives the dsh `0.1.5-rc.2` client-package r
