# dsh Container Image

**[DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (`dsh`) as a batteries-included
container — agent, full toolchain, and a reverse proxy in one image, built from the official source tags.**

## Quick start

### Docker Compose (Linux)

```bash
docker compose -f examples/compose.yaml up -d
docker compose logs dsh | grep 'dsh web:'
# open http://127.0.0.1:3081/ in your local browser (the proxy bootstraps the login)
```

### Podman Quadlet (Linux, recommended)

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /etc/containers/systemd
sudo cp examples/dsh.container /etc/containers/systemd/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now dsh.service
```

Both examples publish `127.0.0.1:3081` and mount one volume at `/home/dsh` — the user layer
(`~/.dsh`, caches, user-installed tools) survives image upgrades while the system layer comes from
the image. There is no login step: the proxy bootstraps the dsh session automatically.

## What's inside

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| Base image | `debian:13-slim` (pinned; overridable via the `BASE_IMAGE` build arg) |
| Toolchain | Node.js 22 LTS, pnpm, uv, Rust/cargo (+ rustfmt/clippy), git + git-lfs, build-essential, Caddy, podman + crun, gh — image-owned real binaries, upgraded with the image |
| Agent CLI tools | ripgrep, fd, python3, zip, openssh-client, tmux, sqlite3, vim.tiny/nano, less, rsync, wget, tree, htop, tzdata, patch — baked into the system layer, so a fresh container never re-downloads them (runtime `apt install` would be lost on recreation) |
| Nested containers | podman in-container (rootless) with `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, subuid/subgid and the network/sysctl defaults preconfigured; the host runtime must allow unprivileged user namespaces + `/dev/fuse` + `/dev/net/tun` and must not mask the container's `/proc` (`--security-opt unmask=ALL`, Quadlet `Unmask=ALL`, Docker `systempaths=unconfined`) — see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) § In-container podman |
| dsh | Built from the official source tag into `/opt/deepseek-harness` (`DSH_TAG` pinnable); no runtime auto-update |
| Exposure | Caddy reverse proxy (`0.0.0.0:3081` → dsh's `127.0.0.1:3080`) with optional basic auth |
| Supervisor | `dsh web` auto-restarts on exit; `docker exec dsh dsh-restart` restarts it manually |
| Remote compatibility | One container-adapt plugin (`container/plugin/`, mounted via `dsh --patch`): session-cookie bootstrap inside dsh, headless-hostile "Open config file" button hidden (`describe` reports no local document), browser-side `isLoopback` patch script |
| Observability | OCI labels, `HEALTHCHECK` (curl 3080 + 3081) |
| Runtime user | uid 1000 (`dsh`), passwordless sudo; `/home/dsh` is the persisted user layer |

## Container-adapt plugin

All container-side adaptation of upstream dsh lives in **one Cordis plugin**, shipped with the
image at `/opt/dsh-container-plugin` and mounted into the web profile via `dsh --patch`:

- **Session-cookie bootstrap** — the plugin exchanges dsh's one-time login token inside the dsh
  process and writes the cookie for the proxy to inject; browsers never see a token.
- **Hidden settings-document button** — "Open config file" has no headless fallback upstream and
  would spawn `xdg-open` into nothing in a container. The plugin makes `settings/describe`
  report `hasDocument: false`, so the button never renders (upstream's own UI logic). Settings
  persist on the mounted volume under `~/.dsh` (upstream v0.1.7+ keeps them per profile in
  `~/.dsh/profiles/<profile>/cordis.patch.yml`; the legacy `settings.yaml` is imported once).
- **Browser-side `isLoopback` patch** — `scripts/patch-client.js` makes settings/credentials work
  through the proxy (applied at image build and before every `dsh web` start).

This plugin is the single adaptation maintenance point. When upstream ships an API that makes part
of it redundant, the release pipeline deletes that part automatically and says so in the release
notes (see [docs/upstream-contract.md](docs/upstream-contract.md) § Simplification triggers).

## Networking & security

- **Port model** — `dsh web` listens on `127.0.0.1:3080` (upstream rejects `--host 0.0.0.0`); the
  exposed port is `3081`, published on host loopback by the examples.
- **The proxy is the security boundary** — Caddy rewrites `Host`/`Origin` to loopback, so remote
  browsers pass dsh's `/api` trust fence, including settings/credentials methods that are otherwise
  loopback-only. Anyone who can reach `3081` gets full control: enable basic auth
  (`DSH_PROXY_USER`/`DSH_PROXY_PASSWORD`, set together or the supervisor refuses to start) and keep
  the port firewalled.
- **Session bootstrapped** — the container-adapt plugin exchanges dsh's one-time login token
  inside the dsh process at startup and the proxy injects the session cookie into every proxied
  request; browsers never see a token.
- **Streams & compression** — SSE/WebSocket pass through unbuffered (verified against Caddy 2.6);
  UI assets are gzip-compressed by dsh's own webserver (≈1.3 MB → ≈360 KB).
- **Telemetry off by default** — the entrypoint sets `DSH_TELEMETRY_MODE=DISABLED`, so the OTel
  feedback uploader never sends anything unless you opt back in. Separate from it, upstream's
  DeepSeek session-log contributor is **on by default** and attaches session-log suffixes to
  DeepSeek API requests — see [docs/security.md](docs/security.md) for what it sends and how to
  turn it off.
- **Client patch** — the container-adapt plugin's `patch-client.js` makes settings/credentials
  usable through the proxy (applied at build time and before every `dsh web` start; if upstream
  changes the bundle strings it warns and skips instead of blocking startup).
- **Extra args** — pass `dsh web` arguments through the container command, e.g.
  `["--port", "8080"]` (internal port only; exposed port stays `3081`).

For WAN access, terminate TLS in front of `3081` (the docs include a working nginx config with
WebSocket headers and raised timeouts) — see [docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md) and
[docs/security.md](docs/security.md).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `DSH_PROXY_USER` / `DSH_PROXY_PASSWORD` | *(empty)* | Basic auth on the exposed proxy (recommended for any non-loopback deployment); set both or neither |
| `DSH_TELEMETRY_MODE` | `DISABLED` | OTel feedback-upload policy; `FEEDBACK_ONLY` restores the upstream default (uploads on explicit feedback), `DISABLED` keeps the OTel path local. It does **not** control the DeepSeek session-log contributor ([security.md](docs/security.md)) |

Everything else uses built-in defaults — dsh data at `~/.dsh`, cwd `$HOME`, writable caches under
`~/.cargo` / `~/.local/share`, image-owned tools in `/usr/local/bin` and `/opt/rust`. The whole
`/home/dsh` is the persistence boundary: mount it as one volume; image upgrades replace the
toolchain, never the data. Details in [docs/build.md](docs/build.md) and
[docs/deployment.md](docs/deployment.md).
