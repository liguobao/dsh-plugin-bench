## Overview

Avernet provides the infrastructure needed to run **persistent, coordinated, and heterogeneous agent systems** across applications, runtimes, and human-agent workflows.

It is built for teams that need to:

- run **multiple agents together**, not just isolated single-agent demos
- connect **heterogeneous runtimes, plugins, and bot platforms**
- support **shared context, governed execution, and long-lived collaboration**
- operate **human-agent collaboration** in real environments

> **Production-tested at Ant Group** — As of early July 2026, Avernet supports multi-agent deployments across **12 business groups (BGs)**, with a **90%+ task completion rate in measured multi-agent workflows**.

## Capabilities & Status

> **Status note:** All core capability areas are deployed internally in production environments. Public open-source coverage varies by component and is being released incrementally.
>
> **Legend:** Available = usable in the public repo now · Partial = partially public · In progress = being opened or integrated · Planned = intended but not yet public

## Quick Start

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inclusionAI/Avernet.git
cd Avernet
```

### Recommended local setup

```bash
./scripts/singlebox.sh install-tools
./scripts/singlebox.sh
```

This starts a local Avernet stack with:

- Avernet process
- frontend workbench
- 5 local test bots

Open the frontend at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

For Docker and advanced setup options, see:

- [Quick Start](docs/quick-start.md)
- [Docker Guide](docs/docker.md)
- [Dependencies](docs/dependencies.md)

## Demo

The current public demo is intended to show:

- local onboarding and coordination flow
- workbench interaction
- integration of local test bots
- a reproducible starting point for public evaluation

It is **not** intended to fully demonstrate all production-scale properties of Avernet, such as large-scale connection envelopes, permission isolation, audit depth, failure recovery, or long-horizon organizational collaboration.

## Why Avernet

As agent systems scale, teams often hit the same four bottlenecks:

- **Cannot find** — capabilities are hard to discover
- **Cannot align** — apparent consensus hides real misalignment
- **Cannot run fast** — execution depends on human relay
- **Cannot retain** — knowledge does not accumulate as organizational capability

Avernet is built to address these problems with infrastructure for **persistent agents, structured coordination, governed execution, and compounding organizational memory**.
