PaperMachine is a desktop app for everyone whose work runs on data — researchers, business analysts, data analysts. You say what you want in one sentence and it runs Python and R on your own machine. The difference is that the result is not handed to you out of a black box: **agent trace** shows the code it ran and the output it got at every step; **result provenance** takes any figure or table back to the code, the log, and the environment that produced it; **data transparency** keeps every dataset it read and every variable it changed open to inspection. You supervise the AI, and the whole process stays under your control.

## Trace: every step it took is right there

![Process view: each reply broken into steps, open any one to read the code it actually ran](docs/media/trace.gif)

Every turn becomes a strip of steps: read the data, clean it, fit the model, draw the chart. Each step shows only a one-line title and a result badge until you open it; inside is the exact code it ran, its output, and the kernel state. Kernel restarts are marked inline, so you always know when variables were cleared. The Python and R kernels persist across turns, so what you built last turn is still there.

When a reviewer asks how those 600 rows were dropped, the answer is on the screen, not in your memory.

## Artifacts: every chart leads back to where it came from

![Artifact provenance: code, log, messages, and environment tabs](docs/media/artifact.gif)

Every figure, table, and file the model produces lands in the artifact panel on the right, with a version number. One click on any artifact opens its provenance in four tabs: the **code** that produced it, the **log** of that execution, the **question and result** it answered, and the **environment** it ran in — package versions, kernel, timestamp. Artifacts produced in other sessions are traced too.

What you hand over is not just a chart, but everything behind it.

## Chart editing: edit it, keep both versions

![Chart editing: change the title and axis labels, save as v2 marked as a human edit](docs/media/chart-edit.gif)

You do not have to go back to the code to fix a figure. Change a matplotlib or ggplot2 chart's title, axis labels, legend position, grid, or font directly in a panel — or select a region on the chart and have the model change only that. Saving writes v2 and marks it as a human edit; v1 stays untouched, and you can compare the two at any time.

## Quick start

1. Download your installer from [Releases](https://github.com/SuperJJ007/papermachine/releases/latest): `PaperMachine-<version>-arm64.dmg` for Apple silicon, `PaperMachine-<version>-x64.dmg` for an Intel Mac, `PaperMachine-<version>-x64.exe` for Windows (**experimental/beta** — see the note below step 4).
2. Open the app and install the environment as described under **First run** below.
3. Open **Settings → Models** and enter your DeepSeek API key. The app ships without one; it calls `deepseek-v4-flash` by default.
4. Drop a CSV, Excel, SPSS, or Stata file into a project and ask your first question, for example: *Plot life expectancy against GDP per capita for 2007, colored by continent.*

### First run

The first time you open PaperMachine it installs its own Python and R environment before opening a workspace. This happens once: afterwards the environment works offline, and later launches go straight to the workspace.

![First run: confirm the download of the general science environment and choose a source](docs/media/install-environment.png)

PaperMachine does not use the conda environments already on your machine. It ships its own micromamba and installs into `~/.papermachine`, so what it runs and which packages are present stay exactly known, and your own environments are left alone.

The choices on this screen:

| Option | When to use it |
|---|---|
| **Download and install** | The default path. Installs the 22-package general science environment: about 850 MB to download, 6 GB of free disk needed. |
| **Package source** | Where packages are pulled from. USTC is preselected when your system language or timezone looks like mainland China, otherwise the official conda-forge channel; you can switch to either of the others, though on Windows TUNA fails every time from a path-length limit, which is why it is listed after USTC. **Picking the wrong one is not fatal** — if the chosen source fails, the remaining sources are tried in order automatically. |
| **View the full package list** | Read exactly which 22 packages are about to be installed. |
| **Advanced: edit the package list** | Add or remove conda packages in the prefilled list, one per line, `name=version` supported. Removing `python` or `r-base` fails the post-install check. |
| **Keep current environment** | Only appears once an environment is already installed. Reinstalling downloads the 850 MB again, so keep it unless you want a different package list. |

The workspace opens when the install finishes, but you cannot ask anything yet — the model key is yours to enter, as in step 3 above.

Neither installer carries a paid Apple/Microsoft signing identity, so macOS and Windows each show their own warning; the fix is different for each.

On macOS, since 0.1.1 the app is ad-hoc signed at build time, so Gatekeeper should give a plain "unidentified developer" rejection rather than reporting the app damaged. Depending on which prompt you see, three fixes apply:

- **macOS 15 (Sequoia) and later**: open **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll to the bottom, and click **Open Anyway**.
- **Older macOS**: right-click the app and choose **Open**.
- **If macOS instead reports the app "is damaged and can't be opened"**, neither of the above fixes that prompt — run the following once instead (`-r` because the app is a directory):

```sh
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PaperMachine.app
```

On Windows, SmartScreen warns about an unrecognized publisher: choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**. The installer is per-user and asks for no administrator rights. It does not require a Visual C++ Runtime already installed on the machine. **The Windows installer is experimental/beta**: its sandbox only partially enforces (not the full isolation macOS gets), R has known edge cases under non-ASCII install paths or usernames, Windows 10 64-bit or later is required, and an issue report should attach `%USERPROFILE%\.papermachine\logs`.

Three bundled skills, invoked by typing `/` in the composer: `scientific-visualization`, `statistical-analysis`, and `scientific-writing`. Your own skills in `~/.papermachine/skills` shadow bundled ones of the same name.

Five science tools the model can call: `run_python`, `run_r`, `get_
