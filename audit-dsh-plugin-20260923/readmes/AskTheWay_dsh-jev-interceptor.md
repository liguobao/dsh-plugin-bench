> ⚡ **Millisecond judgement for every tool call and every recalled message — for about two millionths of a dollar each.**

> Your agent's most expensive habits: asking a poetry-writing LLM yes/no questions, and amputating your context by *age*. This plugin wires [Jev](https://typesafe.ai) — the non-generative "System One" model that broke everyone's feed — into the decision points of [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) where an LLM is overkill and rules are blind.

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

**What it does, in one breath:** before a tool call runs, Jev classifies its risk, irreversibility, task-fit, and injection-suspicion in one ~$0.00002 request — confident high-risk calls get denied, medium ones escalate to a human, and clearly-granted reversible ones stop wasting your clicks on approval dialogs. And when an `@session` snapshot gets injected, Jev scores every message's value for the citing task so the **error traceback survives the byte budget instead of the oldest small talk**. Every doubt, every timeout, every missing key degrades to stock dsh behavior. Nothing to configure away, nothing that can widen a permission.

## Why this exists

dsh ships **zero per-call risk classification** — the pre-execute waterfall's default is a bare `allow`. Its only built-in precedent, `experimental/auto-review`, does the classification with a *generative* LLM: one full model request per tool call, temperature 0, hand-rolled JSON text protocol, self-described as slow, expensive, and experimental. That's a System-2 scribe doing a System-1 reflex's job:

| | auto-review (generative LLM) | dsh-jev-interceptor (Jev) |
|---|---|---|
| Decision shape | emits JSON token-by-token, then parses it and prays | typed `choice`/`noul` answers — type errors are structurally impossible |
| Cost per call | one **full LLM request** | **~$0.00002** (measured: 501 input tokens) |
| Latency | seconds | ~100ms provider-side (TypeSafe-reported p50); ~1s end-to-end from outside US-West |
| Uncertainty | buried in prose | per-question probability distributions + calibrated confidence |
| Failure path | parse fallback → deny | low confidence → `next()` — **it never guesses** |

Jev's maker TypeSafe reports up to **200× faster / 400× cheaper** than LLMs on classification workflows — and this plugin is that number, landed in a real agent harness, with receipts in `/jev-stats`.

We believe this is the **first System-1 decision plugin in the dsh ecosystem**. The full map of where decision models fit in dsh — this plugin's two hooks plus eleven more verified hooks (semantic model routing, context-retention scoring, image-offload pre-planning, worker-report verification...) — is in [docs/jev-usage-points.md](docs/jev-usage-points.md).

## The FIFO pain point nobody talks about

When you `@`-mention a past session in dsh, the harness injects a bounded snapshot of it — and when that snapshot exceeds its byte budget, it drops messages **oldest-first**. Pure FIFO. Zero semantics. The bug report you pasted at the top of the session and the three-line question that started it all? Dropped first. The "thanks!" and "ok, continue"? Kept — they were newer.

dsh's own retention code is honest about it: drop the oldest, then truncate the longest, done. This plugin's `jev-session-reference` row takes that decision over (by subclassing the upstream resolver, so `@`-completion, budgets, spill, and cancellation stay inherited): one Jev fan-out scores each droppable message — *noise / background / relevant / critical* — and the drop order becomes **least valuable first**, with truncation cutting padding before substance. Checkpoints and the newest message stay protected exactly as upstream; the byte budget is honored exactly as upstream; and with `sessionReferenceEnabled: false` (the default) the row renders **byte-for-byte like stock**.

In shadow mode you get the receipts before trusting it: every injection logs the counterfactual — which messages FIFO dropped that scoring would have kept — then flip to `enforce`.

## The 60-second tour

```sh
dsh plugin --profile <name> add dsh-jev-interceptor
```

```yaml
# in your profile's cordis.patch.yml
- id: jev-interceptor
  name: dsh-jev-interceptor
  config:
    enabled: true
    mode: shadow            # watch mode first: records every decision, enforces nothing
    provider: typesafe      # or 'openrouter' (works today, no waitlist) | 'custom'
```

Use your agent normally. In shadow mode every decision lands in telemetry with its full probability distribution; `/jev-stats` summarizes:

```
[guard] calls: 41  degraded: 0  cached: 9
  actions: delegate=33 ask=6 deny=2
  input tokens: 18234  est. cost: $0.000766
  latency: p50 247ms  p95 512ms  max 611ms
```

Happy with the numbers? Flip `mode: enforce`. That's the whole rollout plan — **shadow first, then trust, never guess**.

## Safety model (the part you should actually read)

- **Never `allow`.** "No objection" is expressed as `next()`, so downstream listeners (external hooks, auto-review) keep their veto.
- **Fail-closed everywhere.** No key / provider cooldown / timeout / parse mismatch / internal error → delegate to stock behavior. The approval service's `never` policy is enforced upstream of every listener, so this plugin structurally cannot relax it.
- **Evidence-gated auto-approval.** `allowed-once` requires captured argument evidence: only a call the guard escalated (fresh pending entry, matching session and tool) can be auto-approved. Hook asks and sandbox escalations carry no arguments and always go to the human.
- **Injection-aware.** Tool arguments enter the Jev `state` data field only; `instructions` are fixed strings; a suspected-injection answer *escalates* rather than suppresses. (Jev's maker acknowledges adversarial inputs can sway classifiers — so denial here is an accelerator, never the last line of defense.)
- **Bounded input.** Head+tail argument previews and trailing-message digests — Jev's own guidance is to filter in code and send only what a question needs.
- **Resilient by construction.** Wall-clock timeout per attempt, single retry on 429/529, cooldown after consecutive failures (timeouts count), concurrency cap, LRU decision cache, queue-bound semaphore. A dead provider costs you zero behavior, not your harness.
- **Takeover rows disable as a layer.** The `jev-session-reference` row replaces the upstream `session-reference` row; toggling only this row off in the Plugins UI would leave *no* session-reference active. Remove the takeover by disabling the whole `dsh-jev-interceptor` bundle layer (`setBundleEnabled(false)`), which restores the upstream row.
- **Observable.** Every decision lands in `<dsh-home>/plugins/dsh-jev-interceptor/telemetry.jsonl` (honoring `$DSH_HOME`); `/jev-stats` aggregates it per hook.

All of this is enforced by **63 tests**, including adversarial-review regression cases (a concurrency leak that could hang the tool pipeline, cross-session callId collisions, evidence-free auto-approval).

## Configure

Everything is a config field — timeouts, cooldown, concurrency, cache, per-hook thresholds, tool lists — see the `Config` schema in `src/config.ts`. Notable defaults:

- read-only tools (`read`, `read_image`, `grep`, `glob`, `todo_write`) short-circuit with **zero cost**;
- the Auto permission preset is left entirely to `auto-review` (no double review, no double billing);
- the pre-approval allowlist starts **empty** — until you name tools in `preapproveToolAllowlist`, nothing is ever auto-approved.

Semantic session retention lives on its
