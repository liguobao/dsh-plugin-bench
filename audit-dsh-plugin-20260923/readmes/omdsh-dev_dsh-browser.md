Connect [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) to the Chrome or Firefox tabs you are already using. The model can read page content, operate controls, navigate, and manage tabs while preserving your login state, session, and cookies. A side panel or sidebar provides the conversation UI.

`dsh` is DeepSeek AI's open-source, plugin-based agent harness. This repository provides a companion browser bridge plugin and Chrome/Firefox MV3 extension as one standalone pnpm workspace.

Browser operation remains text-only: pages become structured text with a numbered inventory of interactive elements, and the model addresses those elements by number. dsh 0.1.5 multimodal chat is separate from that page channel—the side panel accepts PNG, JPEG, WebP, and GIF attachments when the host advertises image support, while browser tools still never capture screenshots.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The workspace pins dsh 0.1.5-rc.2, the minimum supported runtime. Older DSH releases are not supported.

## Quick install

The standard `dsh plugin` command alone cannot install this project. The integration contains both a dsh bridge plugin and a browser extension. The one-line installer currently sets up the Chrome build.

macOS and Linux:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Windows, in PowerShell:

```powershell
$s="$env:TEMP\dsh-install.ps1"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $s; powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $s
```

When the installer opens `chrome://extensions`, follow its instructions to load or reload **dsh Browser Assistant**. If dsh is already running, restart it after installation. See [Detailed installation and usage](#detailed-installation-and-usage) for prerequisites, startup commands, updates, and developer installation.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The unscoped [`dsh-browser`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dsh-browser) package on npm belongs to a different project and is not affiliated with this repository. This project is not currently published as an npm package; use the installer above.

## Performance

In a paired 60-run end-to-end benchmark on August 18, 2026, both backends completed all 30 assigned runs successfully, while dsh Browser Control required fewer model/tool round trips and finished faster:

| Backend | Success | Mean end-to-end latency | Mean browser tool calls |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| **dsh Browser Control** | **30/30** | **5.32 s** | **3.4** |
| Matched Playwright baseline | 30/30 | 6.67 s | 4.7 |

The paired Playwright / extension duration ratio was **1.24** (95% CI **1.16–1.34**): Playwright took about 24% longer, or equivalently, dsh Browser Control reduced latency by about 20% and saved 1.35 seconds per task on average. The suite used six browser tasks, five deterministic seeds, the same DSH profile and model (`deepseek-v4-flash`), and independently validated page state. See the [benchmark methodology and reproduction guide](benchmark/README.md).

## Core capabilities

| Capability | Tool | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Read page | `browser_snapshot` | Structured text snapshot: title, URL, main text, numbered controls, and masked form fields; `delta: true` returns only changes |
| Click element | `browser_click` | Click links, buttons, checkboxes, and other controls by inventory number |
| Fill forms | `browser_type` | React/Vue-compatible input; `replace` clears the field first |
| Press keys | `browser_press` | Keyboard events such as Enter, Tab, Escape, and arrow keys |
| Scroll | `browser_scroll` | Viewport scrolling: up, down, top, and bottom |
| Navigate | `browser_navigate` / `browser_open_tab` / `browser_back` / `browser_forward` / `browser_reload` | Navigation inside the controlled tab, or open a URL in a new tab and follow it (`active:false` keeps the current tab in front) |
| List tabs | `browser_list_tabs` | List accessible tabs with stable IDs, titles, URLs, window/index metadata, and active/controlled state |
| Follow tab | `browser_follow_tab` | Bind later browser tools to a tab returned by `browser_list_tabs` without activating it |
| Close tab | `browser_close_tab` | Close a tab returned by `browser_list_tabs` |
| Read region | `browser_get_text` | Lazy-loaded or partial page text |
| Wait for stability | `browser_wait` | Page-load and render-settle detection |
| Send images | `session.prompt` / `session.attachment` | Host-capability-gated image drafts, image-only prompts, and durable history previews |
| Quote a selection | side panel composer | Text you highlight in the page appears in the composer and is sent with your next message as fenced, attributed page content |

## Why this design

- **Your real browser, not a headless copy**: the model works in the page you already have open, retaining logins, sessions, and cookies.
- **A text-first page interface**: numbered controls, stable IDs across snapshots, delta updates, and masked sensitive values make pages operable without screenshots; user-attached chat images use dsh's separate multimodal message path.
- **Pointing instead of describing**: highlight the passage you mean and the side panel quotes it, so "explain this" needs no page tour. The quote is captured only while a panel is open, and nothing is sent until you send the message.
- **A narrow privacy boundary**: passwords and payment-card values are always rendered as `••••` and never leave the page.
- **A guarded bridge**: authenticated handshakes protect remote connections, privileged gateway methods reject non-loopback callers, and the extension binds tools to one user-controlled tab.

## Detailed installation and usage

Requirements: Node.js `^22.19` or `>=24`, Corepack/pnpm, and Chrome 116+ or Firefox 140+. Windows additionally needs Windows PowerShell 5.1, which ships with Windows, or PowerShell 7+.

### Install or update

For a managed installation, run:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

or, on Windows:

```powershell
$s="$env:TEMP\dsh-install.ps1"; irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lum1104/dsh-browser/refs/heads/main/scripts/install.ps1 -OutFile $s; powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File $s
```

The installer downloads `main`, builds and registers the bridge plugin, builds the Chrome extension into `~/.dsh/browser-extension`, and opens `chrome://extensions`. On the first install, load that directory as an unpacked extension; on updates, click **Reload**. Restart dsh if it is already running.

`scripts/install.sh` covers macOS and Linux, and `scripts/install.ps1` covers Windows; both write the same managed workspace and the same install metadata. The installer copies the extension path to the clipboard when a clipboard tool is available (`pbcopy`, `wl-copy`, `xclip`, `xsel`, or PowerShell's `Set-Clipboard`), and prints the path either way. When no Chrome or Chromium install is found, it prints the command that installs one; set `DSH_INSTALL_BROWSER=1` to let the installer attempt that install itself.

The Windows command downloads `install.ps1` and runs it rather than piping it into `Invoke-Expression`: the script is UTF-8 with a byte order mark so Windows PowerShell renders its Chinese output, and `Invoke-Expression` rejects a leading mark. Local checkout paths may contain spaces; the installer registers the bridge through a profile-local directory junction
