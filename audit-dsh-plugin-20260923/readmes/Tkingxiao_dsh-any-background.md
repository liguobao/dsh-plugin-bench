A **DeepSeek Harness** appearance plugin: custom theme color, background wallpaper (image / video / algorithmically generated), and fine-grained per-surface opacity & blur controls. Compatible with **DSH 0.1.5-rc.2 ~ 0.1.7-rc.1** (official-Sidebar UI such as the "Theme" card enables itself where the host exposes the Sidebar registry extension point, and is skipped silently where it does not).

## Features

- **PS-style Color Wheel** — Pick hue on the ring, adjust saturation & lightness in the inscribed square. Generates 30+ CSS design tokens in real time.
- **Precise HSL / RGB Input** — Enter exact color values numerically with instant bidirectional sync to the wheel.
- **Smart Color Extraction** — One click derives a theme color from your wallpaper by sampling the visible region, quantizing, and filtering out gray / near-black / near-white pixels. Video wallpapers contribute via an auto-captured frame. Fully client-side.
- **Eyedropper** — Hover the wallpaper to preview a color and click to pick it as the theme color.
- **Background Wallpaper** — Upload any image as your wallpaper. Drag to pan and scroll to zoom inside a viewport-proportional editor (one finger to pan, two to pinch-zoom on touchscreens).
- **Video Wallpaper** — Use a video as a live wallpaper: muted looping playback that survives refreshes (file persistence + HTTP streaming with Range seek), with an auto-captured frame powering the preview, theme-color extraction, and the position editor.
- **Position Editor** — One shared editor for images and videos: drag to pan, scroll or pinch to zoom, one-click reset. Image and video placements are stored separately and never overwrite each other.
- **Layout Modes** — Fit / Fill / Stretch / Tile / Center for both images and videos; in Fit mode the editor-committed framing stays consistent across window resizes and cross-monitor moves.
- **Generated Dynamic Backgrounds** — Choose mesh gradient, Shader, or geometric patterns with adjustable spread, intensity, and seed locking.
- **Per-surface Interface Opacity** — Independent sliders for the main background, sidebar, cards & panels (including the dropdowns and menus around the dialog), the input & controls (composer box, Cordis panel), the settings panel, the conversation text frame, the trajectory view, the right sidebar (or bettersidebar), produced / highlighted content, and the header popovers (Agent Team panel, background-job list and the session-header dropdowns).
- **Per-surface Interface Blur** — Frosted-glass `backdrop-filter` blur (0–60 px) per surface, including a real backdrop on the composer, the Cordis panel and popover surfaces via stable host selectors.
- **Produced / Highlights** — Code blocks in conversation content (with their language banner), inline `code` highlight chips and produced chips share one opacity + blur slider. The opacity is the alpha of **each surface's own background color** (no second color stacked on top of the original), and the blur frosts that same layer so the wallpaper shows through the content.
- **Right sidebar / bettersidebar surface** — One slider pair (`panelOpacity` / `blurs.panel`), two identities: without dsh-better-sidebar it reads "右方侧边栏" (Right sidebar) and drives the official right Sidebar's surface tokens and frosted blur (works on 0.1.5-rc.2 through 0.1.7); with dsh-better-sidebar installed it reads "bettersidebar" and takes over that plugin's bottom workbench panel (the official sidebar keeps responding too). The row is always visible.
- **Header popovers** — The session-header dropdowns get their own opacity + blur pair: the Agent Team panel, the background-job list, the open-in-app / session-log menus and the subagent lineage tree. On 0.1.7 the open-in-app picker moved to a portal and the session-row menu became a dynamic slot, so the plugin observes the stable `conversation.session.header*` slot anchors and tags the open popover at runtime instead of relying on class shapes.
- **Sidebar "Theme" page (dual mode)** — The same five pages (Color / Interface / Font / Background / Profiles) register into two surfaces: without dsh-better-sidebar, a "Theme" card is contributed to the **official right Sidebar's guide page** through its public extension points (`sidebarRightTabs` + the `sidebar.right.pane.tab` keyed seat); with dsh-better-sidebar installed, the page registers in that plugin's sidebar instead and the official guide card withdraws itself, so the two never duplicate. Settings panel, official sidebar and better-sidebar all share one page implementation and one state store — a change in any of them shows up everywhere. The shell adapts to the panel width, and a narrow panel tightens padding and falls back to a single column. On a host without the right Sidebar the registration silently never happens.
- **Conversation View Cards** — The message list is wrapped in a translucent card automatically, and the trajectory page gets whole-page opacity & blur controls, letting the wallpaper shine through the content.
- **Theme Export / Import** — One-click export to a self-contained `dsh-any-theme.json` (config + wallpaper, video embedded as a data URL) and import to restore it anywhere.
- **Appearance Presets & Profiles** — Six one-click presets (Default / Frosted glass / Minimal / Midnight / Cyber / Warm daylight) plus na
